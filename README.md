A new Flutter project.
Creating and implementing a checkout feature from a sample state management app

I really enjoyed doing this exercise because it is very easy. So far, I haven't encountered any problem when doing this exercise
because I was guided by the samples from the laboratory handouts. Additionally, having clear examples to follow made the process 
straightforward and allowed me to understand the concepts more effectively.
